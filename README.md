Web Designer Test
=================
Download the test using the button on the right or clone it using git. Complete at least 3 of the questions below and either email the hiring manager a compressed folder of the project or submit a pull request here.

Question #1
-----------
Create an **HTML5** page with a `header`, `footer` and `main` section in `index.html`. The main section should contain a content section and a sidebar. Make the sidebar float to the right side of the content section.

`index.html` should include these scripts:

- `https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js`
- `test.js`
- `test.css`

The header section should contain a nav with three links:

- Home ( index.html )
- About ( /about )
- Blog ( /blog )

Question #2
-----------
In the content section of the site, build out a simple blog post that has a featured image. You're free to design it how you like and we suggest using [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.ipsum-generator.com/) for text and [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/) for the image.

Question #3
-----------
Using CSS, make `index.html` responsive. We're looking for a mobile, tablet and desktop layout.

Bonus Question #4
-----------------
Make a new link called "Sidebar" in the nav that hides and shows the sidebar after you click on it.

Bonus Question #5
-----------------
Turn the featured image into a slider with a few images. Use your favorite slider plugin or build your own.
